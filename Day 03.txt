Q1. For the given JSON iterate over all for loops (for, for in, for of, forEach)

The ‘For’ Loop
The For Loop comes first because of its simplicity and ease of use. It is a very user-friendly kind of loop that runs with a method of using a counter. The value is first set with an appropriate condition, which is also called ‘initializing a loop’.

The ‘For In’ Loop
Another way of looping is the For In Loop. Unlike the For Loop, this loop won’t be using a counter. So this makes the whole process even more simple and hassle-free. In fact, the For In Loop is essentially a simplified version of the For Loop.

The ForEach() Loop
This method is used for looping through an array element.
